										<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
									</header>
									<h2>PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND</h2>
									<p>
									My journey started in high school, when I designed custom t-shirts on my friend's screen-printing machine and toted around a notebook, writing the 'Next Great American Novel'. Since then, I've learned the ins-and-outs of computer science, honed my graphic design skills in a variety of gigs, worked as a content-writer, and combined all of these skills to design and build mobile products and web applications.
									<br />
									<br />
									Currently, I'm on the search for my next opportunity.  Ideally, I'm hoping to help shape the future of human-technology interactions through ethical design initiatives.  
									<br />
									<h2 style="margin-top: 2em;">Ethical design</h2>
									My work with my community, combined with my passion for design and technology, has led me to an obssession with this issue. As much as technology has benefited our society, it has also produced many negative externalities. Social media, for instance, seems to have contributed substantially to the mental health crisis. AI has incredible promise, but there are also attendant perils with integrating such a boundlessly powerful technology into our lives. We need better ethical frameworks for design, more conscientious leadership in the design world, and investment in research so that we can gain a deeper understanding of how new technologies can affect us -- both in terms of our individual psychology and our collective social fabric. It's my hope to help pioneer ethical design initiatives that will lead to healthier minds and more vibrant communities.
									<br />
									<br />
									<h2>Outside of work</h2>
									Outside of work, I'm passionate about investing in the next generation, which I do through mentoring and coaching college students.  This past year I led an addiction-recovery group for students struggling with internet-related addictions. A formative experience for me was <a href="https://noahskang.wixsite.com/moria">volunteering at a refugee camp in Greece in 2017.</a>
