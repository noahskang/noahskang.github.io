										<h2>
											Context
										</h2>
										<p>
											NestEgg aims to help ordinary people achieve financial independence through real-estate. We do this by empowering mom and pop landlords to easily self-manage their own portfolios. (To learn more, check out our <a href="https://nestegg.rent/">website.</a>) We also value putting human relationships at the center of the rental experience, doing with long-term renting what AirBNB did with short-term stays.
											<br/><br/>
											One of NestEgg's key features is on-demand maintenance coordination. When a resident reports a maintenance issue, NestEgg handles it so that the landlord doesn't need to be bothered - finding local Pros, handling scheduling, and providing live in-app updates to the landlords.
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="content-block">
										<h2>Problem</h2>
										<p>
										A significant percentage of our users were not using our maintenance feature, which was the lynch pin of our business model. We wanted to figure out why.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="content-block">
										<h2>
											My Role
										</h2>
										<p class="_1em-bottom">
											I worked as the principle UX Researcher and Designer on this project, collaborating with our Product Manager, Chris Le, and the rest of our design team.

											<h2>
												Step 1: Investigation
											</h2>
											<p class="_1em-bottom">
												I started with some <strong>initial hypotheses</strong>:
											</p>
												<ul>
													<li>
														<strong>Visibility</strong> - Users may not know that the maintenance feature exists.
													</li>
													<br />
													<li>
														<strong>Education</strong> - Users may not understand what our maintenance product can do for them.
													</li>
													<br />
													<li>
														<strong>Friction</strong> - Users may find our existing maintenance flow too confusing.
													</li>
												</ul>
											<p><strong>Competitor analysis</strong> of companies like Thumbtack, Jiffy, and Angie's list, was also helpful in identifying common patterns.</p>
											</div>

													<i class="img-caption">Old designs</i>
												</div>
											</div>
										</div>

											<p>
												Next, we <strong>analyzed tracking data</strong>, which showed <strong>high drop-off</strong> at the start of our maintenance funnel. We were using a 'chat-bot' interaction for landlords to report maintenance issues, and many of our users didn't make it past the first couple of messages.

										<h3>
											User interviews
										</h3>
										<p class="">In interviews with our research group we gave the users common use cases (e.g., ‘you have a broken faucet. How would you use NestEgg to get this issue fixed?’) and examined how they interacted with the App. We also surveyed users about their experience with NestEgg.</p>
										<div class="image main">
											<img src="images/user-interviews.jpg" alt="">
											<i class="img-caption">User interviews</i>
										</div>

										<p class="">We consolidated and prioritized our findings, based on criteria like the estimated impact of each issue and how easily we thought we could solve it.</p>

										<h2>Step 3: Redesign</h2>
										<p>
											I began with flow-charts and lo-fi mockups, which I honed with the help of internal testing with our team, as well as with third-party testers.
										</p>

										<h1 style="margin-bottom: 1em">Summary of changes</h1>
										<h2>
											Increased Discoverability:
										</h2>
										<p>Changes we made to increase visibility of the maintenance feature:</p>
										<div class="row" style="margin-top: 3em;">
											<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
												<img src="images/xsell.jpg" class="discoverability-images grow-img-scale" alt="">
												<h3>
													Integration with rent
												</h3>
												<p>
													To target users who didn't know about NestEgg maintenance, I added a cross-sell module to the rent onboarding flow.
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
												<img src="images/timeline-module.jpg" class="discoverability-images grow-img-scale" alt="">
												<h3>
													Top-level visibility
												</h3>
												<p>
													I added a Timeline module that would be the first thing that users see when they open the App. <i>In a later sprint, we revisited the Timeline and <a href="dashboard.html">turned it into a more useful <strong>dashboard</strong></a>.</i>
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
												<img src="images/takeover.jpg" class="discoverability-images grow-img-scale" alt="">
												<h3>
													<strike>Takeover</strike>
												</h3>
												<p>
													We decided against a takeover ad on the homepage after receiving negative user feedback on the change. While it elevated the visibility of maintenance, and may have helped our bottom-line, it <strong>was not user-centered.</strong>
												</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<h2>Marketing campaign:</h2>
										<p>I know that a key part of driving greater adoption of our maintenance service was marketing, so I intiiated an <strong>email coupon campaign</strong> with our marketing team to drive first-time adoption of maintenance. (The data showed that once a landlord used maintenance once, they were likely to be a repeat customer.)
										</p>
										<h2>
											Simplified issue reporting:
										</h2>
										<p>One of the key changes we made to our maintenance flow was to replace the chat-bot with a form. Our hypothesis was that many users would actually prefer a form to a chat-bot, due to the speed with which a form can be completed. We developed the form with plans to AB test it against our chat bot.</p>
										<div class="image main grow-img-scale">
											<img class="grow-img-shadow" src="images/chat-problems.jpg" alt="old designs" title="old designs"/>
											<i class="img-caption">chat vs form</i>
										</div>
										<h2>
											Decreased time-to-price:
										</h2>
										<p>After users reported a maintenance issue, they would need to wait for our ops team to generate a price (up to 24 hrs). But by that time, many users would already start looking for Pros on their own. I realized that if we could automatically show the user a price estimate based on their job type (based on data abt prices of past jobs, categorized by type), we could show a price to landlords immediately, <strong>cutting 'time-to-price' from 24 hours to minutes.</strong></p>
										<h3>Old flow</h3>
										<p>After a user reports an issue, they have to wait for up to 24 hours before they can view a price and book a Pro.</p>
										<div class="image main grow-img-scale">
											<img class="grow-img-shadow" src="images/chat-flow.jpg" alt="old designs" title="old designs"/>
											<i class="img-caption">Old flow with chat</i>
										</div>
										<h3>New flow</h3>
										<p>After reporting an issue, user sees a price instantly (based on historic averages for the trade that they selected) and can book a Pro immediately!</p>
										<div class="image main grow-img-scale">
											<img class="grow-img-shadow" src="images/trade-flow.jpg" alt="old designs" title="old designs"/>

										<div class="content-block">
												<h1>conclusion</h1>
												<h2>Were we successful?</h2>
												<p>We were able to transform the maintenance service in a way that vastly improved our users' experience. We directly addressed some user pain-points, saw increased up-take of our maintenance product, and received positive feedback about the changes from our users.<br /><br /> One takeaway for the future is to improve our AB testing framework so that we can have more data to back our design choices.</p>
