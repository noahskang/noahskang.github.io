												<h2>Context</h2>
												<p>
													NerdWallet’s mission is to empower users with the information they need to make life’s financial decisions with confidence. The rise of LLMs presented both a challenge and an opportunity to advance this mission. I led a hackathon team to create an MVP of a chat module incorporating ChatGPT technology, winning the top award and inspiring leadership to establish a dedicated AI team, where I led design.
