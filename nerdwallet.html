												<h2>Context</h2>
												<p>
													In 2023, I led a hackathon team to create an MVP chat module incorporating ChatGPT technology, winning the top award and inspiring leadership to establish a dedicated AI team, where I led design.</p>
													<p>NerdWallet’s mission is to empower users with the information they need to make financial decisions confidently. The rise of LLMs presented a competitive challenge to us. But could we harness this technology and offer our own unique service?

											<h1>User Research</h1>
											<p>I began by conducting extensive user research studies, including surveys, preference tests, and video-recorded prototype tests with early design iterations.  I made sure to procure my product manager's feedback as I designed these studies to keep her involved in the process and help ensure that what our tests were investigating would be relevant to her product vision.

												<h3>Key Insights</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>
														<b>&#x23F0; Efficiency:</b> Users struggle with information overload from lengthy articles. They value time and efficiency, making an AI chat that provides quick, precise answers highly desirable.
														</li>
														<li><b>&#x2714; Trustworthiness:</b> Users are skeptical of LLMs. We need to build trust - for instance, by linking responses to NerdWallet’s expert-written content.</li>
														<li> &#x1F50D; <b>Discoverability:</b> Amidst NerdWallet's vast content, the chat needs to stand out without adding too much noise or clutter to the user interface.</li>
														<li> &#x1F4A1; <b>Clarity:</b> Users often confused our AI chat with a traditional customer service chatbots. Clearly signaling the advanced capabilities of the chat - through design elements or copy - would be crucial.</li>
														</ul>

												<h3>Defining requirements</h3>
												<p>I supported my product manager to help define project requirements and milestones. Regular syncs with key stakeholders kept expectations realistic and aligned.

													<h1>Post-Development</h1>
												<h2 style="margin-top: 2em">Analysis and iteration</h2>
													<p>After rolling out NerdWallet AI, we used AB testing to evaluate the success of our designs.  We supplemented the quantitative data with further video user testing to obtain a qualitative sense of the user experience. (I shared out these findings in detailed decks so that the team could put our heads together to identify the best ways to iterate.)</p>
												
													<div class="image main">
														<img class="img-shadow" src="images/closing-slides.png"/>
													</div>
													The qualitative data through usertesting helps us interpret the quantitative data that we receive. For instance, an early pass of NerdWallet AI, which was designed as a pop-up chat, had low engagement. Our user research revealed that many users reflexively closed the pop-up.  Switching to a version of the chat that was inline with the page helped increase user engagement, from 1.42% to up to 5.01%.

														</div>
														<div class="5u 12u$(small)">
															<h3>Product expansion</h3>
															<p>Initially, we rolled the chat out on articles as a supplement to the user's reading experience. After seeing success, this expanded to a prominent placement on the home page. Most recently, we moved to include personalization capability by integrating the chat with user's bank account information.</p>
